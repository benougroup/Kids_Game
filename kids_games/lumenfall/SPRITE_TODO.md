# Lumenfall Sprite / Asset TODO

These are the art assets still needed to fully support the mechanics now wired in:

## High priority
- **Light post sprites** (off + lit variants), ideally with frame names like `lightpost_off`, `lightpost_on`.
- **Door/gate states** for push/open/closed so we can implement movable blockers.
- **1x1 and 2x2 blocking props**: cart, boat, chairs, tables, logs, crates, barrels.

## Terrain progression
- **Elevation tiles** for hill transitions (slope up/down edges) so height changes read clearly.
- **Road variants** for stone, dirt, brick, grass edge blending.
- **Water set** including river corners/edges + shallow/deep variants.

## Interactables
- **Pickup sprites** for floor loot (rocks, herbs, scraps, keys).
- **Trap door / hidden entrance** tiles for conditional walkability.

## Nice-to-have next
- **Shadow monster variants** (small silhouettes with subtle glow edge).
- **Ambient light source sprites** (torches, campfires, shrine lights).

## Temporary placeholders currently used
- Sign posts are used as temporary stand-ins where light posts should be.
